# 🧠 CIFAR-10 Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a simple yet effective Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The model is trained to recognize 10 object categories such as airplanes, cars, cats, and ships.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Learn how to apply CNNs to real-world image classification with clear visualizations and evaluation metrics.
